## üìú Overview of Founding Papers

### 1. [Intelligent systems projects for military purposes]([project] Intelligent systems for military purposes.pdf)
**Central thesis**:  
Military AI must combine strategic foresight and an ethical framework, drawing inspiration from human cognition.

#### Key contributions:
- **ANELLA**: A collaborative AI model inspired by psychoanalysis (Freud/Lacan), based on:
  - Historical semantic networks
  - Simulated affect dynamics
  - Knowledge negotiation
- **Augmented foresight**: Extension of determinism by adding dimensions (climate, geopolitics, migration flows)
- **Neural briefings**: Reduction of cognitive load through information compression
- **Ethical principles**: Need to incorporate ethical filters and avoid the illusion of total control

### 2. [Technological evolution: an extension of biology?](Conference_AI.pdf)
**Revolutionary postulate**:  
Technology constitutes a new stage in biological evolution, which must be studied as an anthropological phenomenon.

#### Key insights:
- **Muscular thinking**: Ontological difference between AI and human cognition (Einstein reference)
- **Sensitive body** as the foundation of scientific abstraction
- Critique of the natural/artificial dichotomy
- Technology as an adaptive response to ecological crises
- Consciousness as an epiphenomenon of language and affect (Jorion)

## üß† Philosophical Positioning
1. **Anti-reductionist**:  
   AI does not reproduce human intelligence but creates an alternative form of intelligence.
   
2. **Corpocentric**:  
   Cognition emerges from bodily sensitivity‚Äîdisembodied AI remains fundamentally limited.

3. **Evolutionary Continuist**:  
   `Biological ‚Üí Technological` as a new Hegelian sequence

   
4. **Applied ethics**:  
Military AI requires safeguards against uncontrolled emergence
